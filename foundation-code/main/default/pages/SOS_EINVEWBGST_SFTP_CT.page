            <b><u> Scope of Services for Annual Maintenance Charges - Integration- </u></b>

           <p>This typically includes application bug fixes, fixes to reports that are inaccurate, correcting business rules that contain bad logic. The scope of work under the annual maintenance covers maintenance of the deliverables delivered under the scope of Development and Enhancement Services agreed with the Customer. The Company agrees to maintain, repair or rectify defect or remedy to ensure that the functionality of the said deliverables are restored to the desirable condition. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, these services shall be limited to the deliverables delivered by the Company and shall not cover any feature enhancement, new development or integration, and shall be subjected to the scope limitations and customer dependencies set out in  below.<br/><br/>
           
Customer may avail annual maintenance services for integration during the Period of Engagement (mentioned  below) by paying appropriate fee for AMC. The AMC support will include fixing any breakages in functionality only with respect to the original scope of work for integration. It shall exclude:
</p>
           <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
           <li>additional features or enhancements which are not contained in the original scope of work for integration.</li>
 <li>breakages in functionality arising out of any subsequent changes (including but not limited to changes in APIs / schema fields) stipulated by the government/GSTN/NIC after the initially agreed scope of work. 
</li>
 
           </ol>
 
           <p>The Company shall perform Annual Maintenance Services that encompass modifications that fix problems in the developed solution caused by design, logic, or coding errors. This type of maintenance is often triggered by an explicit service desk ticket and often involves errors that must be addressed immediately. The hosting of FTP server can be done at Client or Cleartax side. 
           <br/> <br/>
           Client IT Side (Development and FTP server hosted by the client) - AMC is applicable only for program level issues like dump error, etc but not the FTP server (network related issues are not supported)<br/><br/>
System Integrator (FTP server hosted by the client): AMC is applicable only for program level issues like dump error, etc but not the FTP server (network issues not supported), and Cleartax/System Integrator is responsible for any changes in CSV or Excel file in future.<br/><br/>
System Integrator/Inhouse Team (Development and FTP server hosted by the Cleartax): AMC is applicable for program level and FTP server related issues.<br/><br/>


Examples of issues that require corrective maintenance include the following: <br/><br/>
<b>Program level:<br/></b>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Excel file is created/not created but incomplete fields, not pushed into ftp server</li>
 <li>Response file is given back from ClearTax, the program cannot read the response file from Database(client ERP)</li>
 <li>It can be a dump error</li>
 <li>FTP Consultation/Queries</li>
</ol>

<b>FTP level:<br/></b>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
 <li>Connection related issues - listing the directory and files</li>
 <li>Permission related issues - Client can provide the necessary access(READ, WRITE and RENAME) to the Cleartax Inhouse team /System Integrator to address the issues</li>
</ol>
 
           
The Company shall perform all project phases and activities required to build, test and deploy all Corrective Maintenance changes as necessary to fix the integration problems. This consists of the action(s) taken to restore a failed system to operational status. This usually involves replacing or repairing the software component that is responsible for the failure in the system. Corrective maintenance is performed at unpredictable intervals. The objective of corrective maintenance is to restore the system to satisfactory operation within the shortest possible time. Corrective maintenance is also undertaken to ensure continuing operations for software version/platform/infrastructure changes (e.g. operating system upgrades or ERP upgrades) when the impacted business application/system would otherwise not work as a direct result of that version/platform/infrastructure change.
