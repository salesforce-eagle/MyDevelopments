                     <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                         <li><b>Ingest purchase register and run reconciliation</b> manually or automatically.</li>

                         <li><b>Automate payment actions</b> as per the MaxITC results which will ensure GST will be held in case the payment status is ‘hold gst’ and payment will happen as-is if the payment status is ‘make full payment’. When the payment status for a document changes from ‘hold gst’ to ‘make full payment’ in future reconciliation run, the GST amount will be released in the next payment cycle.</li>
