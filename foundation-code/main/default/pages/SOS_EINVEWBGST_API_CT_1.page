            <b><u> Scope of Services for Annual Maintenance Charges - Integration - </u></b>

           <p>This typically includes application bug fixes, fixes to reports that are inaccurate, correcting business rules that contain bad logic. The scope of work under the annual maintenance covers maintenance of the deliverables delivered under the scope of Development and Enhancement Services agreed with the Customer. The Company agrees to maintain, repair or rectify defect or remedy to ensure that the functionality of the said deliverables are restored to the desirable condition. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, these services shall be limited to the deliverables delivered by the Company and shall not cover any feature enhancement, new development or integration, and shall be subjected to the scope limitations and customer dependencies set out in  below.<br/><br/>
           
Customer may avail annual maintenance services for integration during the Period of Engagement (mentioned  below) by paying appropriate fee for AMC. The AMC support will include fixing any breakages in functionality only with respect to the original scope of work for integration. It shall exclude:
</p>
           <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
           <li>additional features or enhancements which are not contained in the original scope of work for integration.</li>
 <li>breakages in functionality arising out of changes in the ERP/billing software version/platform/infrastructure changes (e.g. operating system upgrades or ERP upgrades).</li>
 <li>breakages in functionality arising out of any subsequent changes (including but not limited to changes in APIs / schema fields) stipulated by the government/GSTN/NIC after the initially agreed scope of work. 
</li>
 
           </ol>
 
            <p>The Company shall perform Annual Maintenance Services that require modifications to fix problems in the developed solution caused by design, logic, or coding errors. This type of maintenance is often triggered by an explicit service desk ticket. Issues that may require corrective maintenance are as follows: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Calculations that generate incorrect totals</li>
 <li>Data screens that omit a required entry or store an entry in the improper location</li>
 <li>Improper logic in business rules</li>
 <li>Aborted programs</li>
 <li>Error messages</li>
 <li>Interfaces that are not functioning as designed</li>
 <li>Application configuration issues</li>
 
</ol>
 
<p>

The Company shall perform corrective maintenance and activities required to fix the integration problems. This usually involves replacing or repairing the software component that is responsible for the failure in the system. Corrective maintenance is performed at unpredictable intervals. The objective of corrective maintenance is to restore the system to satisfactory operation within the shortest possible time.
